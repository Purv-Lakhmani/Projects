                <p>The Monarch Butterfly (Danaus plexippus) is a well-known and easily recognizable butterfly species. They are famous for their striking orange, black, and white wing patterns and their remarkable migration journey across North America.</p>
                <h2>Habitat</h2>
                <p>Monarch Butterflies inhabit a variety of environments, including fields, meadows, gardens, and open woodlands. They are often found in areas with abundant milkweed plants, which are crucial for their reproduction.</p>
                <h2>Diet</h2>
                <p>Adult Monarch Butterflies primarily feed on nectar from a variety of flowering plants. As caterpillars, they exclusively feed on milkweed leaves, which provide essential toxins that make them distasteful to predators.</p>
                <h2>Behavior and Social Interaction</h2>
                <p>Monarch Butterflies are solitary and are known for their impressive migratory behavior. They travel thousands of miles from North America to Central Mexico to escape the cold winters. This migration is one of the most remarkable phenomena in the insect world.</p>
                <h2>Interaction with Humans</h2>
                <p>Monarch Butterflies are not harmful to humans and are admired for their beauty and ecological significance. They play a crucial role in pollination and are often the focus of conservation efforts due to their declining populations.</p>
